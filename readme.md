# Types of API
1. SOAP API
- Simple Object Access Protocol API is a protocol for exchanging XML-based messages over a computer network, normally using HTTP/HTTPS. SOAP is an XML-based protocol for accessing web services over HTTP. It has some specification which could be used across all applications. SOAP is known as the Simple Object Access Protocol, but in later times was just shortened to SOAP v1.2.

2. REST API
- REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is an architectural style not a protocol. It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API. One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL. Each URL is called a request while the data sent back to you is called a response.

3. GraphQL API
- GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools
